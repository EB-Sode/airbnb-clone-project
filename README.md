# airbnb-clone-project

## OVERVIEW
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## OBJECTIVE
 User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
 Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
 Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
 Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
 Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
 Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.


## TEAM ROLES
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## TECHNOLOGY STACK
 Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
 Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
 PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
 GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
 Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
 Redis: Used for caching and session management.
 Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

## DATABASE DESIGN
 	1. User
Represents customers (guests) and property owners (hosts).
Fields:

id (Primary Key)

name

email (unique, for login)

role (guest, host, or admin)

date_joined

Relationships:

A user can list multiple properties (if they’re a host).

A user can make multiple bookings (if they’re a guest).

A user can leave reviews for properties.

A user can make payments for bookings.

2. Property
Represents a listing (apartment, house, etc.).
Fields:

id (Primary Key)

title (e.g., “Cozy 2BR Apartment”)

location (address or city)

price_per_night

host_id (Foreign Key → User)

Relationships:

A property belongs to a host (user).

A property can have multiple bookings.

A property can have multiple reviews.

3. Booking
Represents a reservation made by a guest.
Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → User, the guest)

property_id (Foreign Key → Property)

check_in_date

check_out_date

status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

Relationships:

A booking belongs to a user (the guest).

A booking belongs to a property.

A booking can have one payment.

4. Review
Represents feedback left by guests after staying.
Fields:

id (Primary Key)

user_id (Foreign Key → User, the guest)

property_id (Foreign Key → Property)

rating (1–5 stars)

comment

Relationships:

A review belongs to a user (the guest who wrote it).

A review belongs to a property.

5. Payment
Represents a transaction for a booking.
Fields:

id (Primary Key)

booking_id (Foreign Key → Booking)

amount

payment_method (card, PayPal, etc.)

payment_status (paid, pending, failed)

Relationships:

A payment belongs to a booking.

Through the booking, it’s indirectly linked to user and property.


## Feature breakdown

1. User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and roles (guest, host, admin).
This feature ensures that users can create accounts, securely log in, and manage their profiles. Role separation allows hosts to list properties, guests to make bookings, and admins to oversee the platform.

2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, and remove properties.
Hosts can add property details (title, description, price, location, images) and manage availability. This feature ensures the platform has a diverse and up-to-date set of listings for guests to browse.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for chosen dates.
It handles reservation requests, availability checks, and booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled). This feature is central to the platform, connecting guests with host properties in a structured way.

4. Review & Rating System
Allows guests to leave reviews and rate properties after stays.
This builds trust and transparency by letting future guests make informed choices. It also helps hosts improve their services based on feedback.

## Security 

1. Authentication (Secure Login & Identity Verification)
Measure: Use secure password storage (hashed + salted), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and OAuth2/social logins (optional).

Why it’s crucial: Ensures that only legitimate users (guests, hosts, admins) can access their accounts, protecting sensitive data such as personal info and booking history.

2. Authorization (Role-Based Access Control – RBAC)
Measure: Define roles (guest, host, admin) and enforce permissions at every endpoint.

Why it’s crucial: Prevents unauthorized access — for example, a guest should not be able to delete another host’s property, and only admins should manage system-wide settings.

3. Data Protection & Encryption
Measure: Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all communication, encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., payment details), and follow GDPR/CCPA guidelines for user data.

Why it’s crucial: Protects against data theft and eavesdropping, ensuring sensitive information like emails, IDs, and payment details remain private.

4. Payment Security
Measure: Use trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with PCI-DSS compliance instead of storing card data directly.

Why it’s crucial: Prevents financial fraud and liability risks while ensuring user trust during transactions.

5. Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection
Measure: Limit login attempts, use CAPTCHA, and apply API request throttling.

Why it’s crucial: Protects against brute-force login attempts, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and malicious API abuse.

6. Input Validation & Sanitization
Measure: Sanitize all user input, use ORM to prevent SQL injection, and escape output to prevent XSS.

Why it’s crucial: Prevents common web vulnerabilities that could lead to data leaks, defacement, or system compromise.

7. Logging & Monitoring
Measure: Maintain secure logs of user activity, booking/payment events, and admin actions.

Why it’s crucial: Helps detect suspicious behavior early (e.g., repeated failed logins, fraudulent bookings) and supports incident response.

8. Backups & Disaster Recovery
Measure: Regular database backups, secure storage, and rollback plans.

Why it’s crucial: Ensures business continuity in case of system crashes, attacks (like ransomware), or accidental data loss.
